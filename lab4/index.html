			<h2>Pseudocode for High-level tasks for making Guacamole</h2>
			<pre><code>
				1. Buy ingredients
					a. Buy 3 avocado
					b. Buy 1 onions
					c. Buy 1 tomato
					d. Buy 2 peppers
					e. Buy 1 lemon
				2. Mash avocado
					a. Slice avocado in half with a knife
					b. Remove the pit
					c. Put avocado into a bowl
					d. Mash the avocado with a fork
				3. Add side ingredients  
					a. Cut onions, tomato, and peppers into dice with a knife
					b. Add the diced onions, tomato, and peppers into the mashed avocado
				4. Cut lemon into half with a knife
				5. Squeeze lemon juice into the bowl
				6. Add salt and pepper
				7. Mix everything together

			// index.js - Connect 4

			/ Author: Ashley Hom & Cho Wing Koon
			// Date: October 23 2023

			// Pseudocode
			// Print a 6 X 7 grid with a circle in the middle of each squares
			// Accept user input for color
  				// Asks user if they want to be red or yellow
			// Accept user input for move
			// Validate user move
			// Evaluate possible moves
			// Choose computer move
			// Test of win or lose condition
  			// End game if 4 of the same color circles are connected in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row
    			// Player of that color wins
			// Repeat if win or lose condition is not met

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge is to learn the habit of thnking ahead with pseudocoding before starting to code officially.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We got a little confused when adding the pseudocode and html images to the page since we
						were unsure where to add them. We eventually figured out and added the images at the bottom.
						We also struggled in javascript because we don't know how many indentations we should use.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We learned that pseudocoding is an important step and helps us understand the logic of our code. 
						It was also the first time we used javascript, so it was interesting to learn how to add a comment 
						and how it work.
						We created a pseudocode list for the steps to making guacamole and a pseudocode list for the steps to making a connect 4 game. 
						
						<br>Here is the list for making guacamole: 
						<pre><code>
							1. Buy ingredients
								a. Buy 3 avocado
								b. Buy 1 onions
								c. Buy 1 tomato
								d. Buy 2 peppers
								e. Buy 1 lemon
							2. Mash avocado
								a. Slice avocado in half with a knife
								b. Remove the pit
								c. Put avocado into a bowl
								d. Mash the avocado with a fork
							3. Add side ingredients  
								a. Cut onions, tomato, and peppers into dice with a knife
								b. Add the diced onions, tomato, and peppers into the mashed avocado
							4. Cut lemon into half with a knife
							5. Squeeze lemon juice into the bowl
							6. Add salt and pepper
							7. Mix everything together
						</pre></code>
						
						<br>Here is the list for making a connect 4 game: 
						<pre><code>
							1. Print a 6 X 7 grid with a circle in the middle of each squares
							2. Accept user input for color
								a. Asks user if they want to be red or yellow
							3. Accept user input for move
							4. Validate user move
							5. Evaluate possible moves
							6. Choose computer move
							7. Test of win or lose condition
								a. End game if 4 of the same color circles are connected in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row
								b. Player of that color wins
							8. Repeat if win or lose condition is not met
						</pre></code>
