                        <p>The challenge of the lab is to fix old labs with our debugging knowledge.</p>

                        <h2>Problems</h2>
                        <p>The problems we encountered during the lab was we tried to make the buttons for lab 9 centered but 
                        Wing couldn't make the buttons centered even though she has the same code as Ashley. We asked the TA and she couldn't 
                        find the reason either. We took a break and tried to make the numbers appear in organized columns in lab 13.
                        We were able to figure it out after referencing to CSS column property online. In our freetime, we tested comments from
                        online about making button in the center and finally was able to debug lab 9 for Wing. 
                        </p>

                <div class="results">
                        <h2>Results</h2>
                        <p>We were able to put numbers into columns when the "Run" button is clicked in lab 13 and center the buttons in lab 9.

                <img id="lab9-code" src="img/lab9-debug.png" /><br>
                <img id="lab9-beforeClick" src="img/before-click.png" /><br>
                <img id="lab9-afterClick" src="img/after-click.png" /><br>
                <p>In lab 9, the buttons were off centered, so we tried to debug and position them in the center. At first, we thought there was 
                something wrong in the CSS, but the buttons were centered for Ashley even though we both use the same code. We tried looking at 
                the lectures and eventually asked the TA for help. The TA looked at our code and couldn't find the problem either, so we stopped 
                debugging it. After section, in our freetime, we searched more website online and testing people's comments and finally debugged 
                the issue. The buttons were centered after turning the element into a block then use margin 0 auto to make sure they are centered.
