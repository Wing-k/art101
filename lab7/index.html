					<h2>Challenge</h2> 
					<p>We practice writing functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We struggled to link the Javascript to the index.html. 
						The Javascript would not show the output on the html file and 
						we could not find what was causing the problem. 
						We realized after checking the code that there was a typo and it worked after we fixed the typo.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We created a function that take user input of their name 
						and manipulated it by changing the string into an array and sorrting it by alphebet.</p>
