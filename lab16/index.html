                        <p>The challenge of the lab is to experiment with processing JSON from an API.</p>

                        <h2>Problems</h2>
                        <p>The problems we encountered during the lab was followed the ajax structure from lectures snd pulled the API correctly in Javascript, 
                        but we could not get the image to display on our website. We double checked everything and asked the TA for help. At first, we thought it was 
                        something wrong with the code and tried to figure out the issue, but the TA checked and nothing is wrong. We seached up for solutions 
                        and it might have been the CORS extension so we tried to see the issue. We spent almost the whole section trying to debug and realized at the end
                        that we made a minor typo in the word "src" when displaying the image in Javascript. We used "scr" instead of "src".
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="results">
                        <h2>Results</h2>
                        <p>We created a button that says "Click to read a comic" in our HTML. We then used jQuery to add an event listener to the button and 
                        created a function that calls on the AJAX to fetch the output from comic 164 API. If it is successful, the Javascript will return 
                        the title, image, and title attribute to the output section. If there is an error, the console will display the error.
